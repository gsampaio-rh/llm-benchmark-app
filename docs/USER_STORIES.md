## 1. Prompt & Completion Dynamics

* *As a creative writer using the engine,* I want to provide a **short prompt with a long completion**, so that I can test how well the engine supports **story expansion or ideation tasks**.
* *As a researcher running retrieval QA,* I want to provide a **long prompt with a short completion**, so that I can test **accuracy and responsiveness for knowledge-intensive queries**.
* *As a legal analyst simulating document review,* I want to provide a **long prompt with a long completion**, so that I can test **summarization and drafting performance under heavy load**.
* *As a chat user,* I want to provide a **short prompt with a short completion**, so that I can test **interactive Q&A performance**.
* *As a developer testing the engine,* I want to run benchmarks with **short prompts (e.g., 5â€“20 tokens)**, so that I can measure **interactive, chat-like workloads** where users ask simple questions.
* *As a researcher evaluating performance,* I want to run benchmarks with **long prompts (e.g., thousands of tokens)**, so that I can measure **how the engine handles large context windows** such as long documents or conversations.
* *As a developer simulating chatbots,* I want to run benchmarks with **short completions (e.g., 10â€“50 tokens)**, so that I can validate **responsiveness in quick Q&A use cases**.

## 2. Traffic Load Scenarios

* *As a solo developer testing responsiveness,* I want to send **sequential single-user requests**, so that I can establish a **baseline latency profile**.
* *As a systems engineer testing throughput,* I want to simulate **many concurrent requests of similar size**, so that I can measure **scalability under homogeneous load**.
* *As an SRE validating scheduling fairness,* I want to simulate **concurrent requests of mixed sizes**, so that I can observe **how the engine handles heterogeneous workloads**.
* *As an ops engineer stress-testing capacity,* I want to simulate **burst traffic spikes**, so that I can see whether **the system gracefully handles sudden load increases**.
* *As a reliability tester,* I want to simulate **sustained long-running traffic**, so that I can measure **system stability over time**.

* *As a systems engineer benchmarking the engine,* I want to run workloads with **concurrent short and long requests mixed together**, so that I can evaluate **how well the engine schedules and batches heterogeneous traffic** without penalizing latency-sensitive queries.

## 3. Streaming & Interaction

* *As a chatbot user,* I want to test **streaming with a short prompt**, so that I can measure **time-to-first-token responsiveness**.
* *As a knowledge worker submitting long documents,* I want to test **streaming with a long prompt**, so that I can confirm **stable interactive performance at scale**.

## 4. Context Window Stress

* *As a researcher testing context limits,* I want to submit **prompts close to the maximum context length**, so that I can evaluate **edge-of-capacity performance**.
* *As an API integrator optimizing caching,* I want to send **sliding-window style prompts** (long histories with small changes), so that I can measure **KV cache reuse efficiency**.
* *As a data scientist scaling prompt sizes,* I want to test **incrementally increasing input lengths**, so that I can observe **latency growth patterns**.

## 5. Robustness & Error Handling

* *As a QA tester,* I want to send **malformed or pathological inputs** (e.g., garbage tokens, unbroken strings), so that I can measure **how gracefully the engine rejects or handles them**.
* *As a red-team tester,* I want to send **adversarial prompts** (weird Unicode, extreme parameters), so that I can check for **stability under hostile inputs**.
* *As an SRE testing reliability,* I want to simulate **timeouts and cut-offs**, so that I can verify **graceful recovery without engine crashes**.

## 6. Resource & Scaling Scenarios

* *As an engineer pushing GPU limits,* I want to run workloads until **VRAM saturation**, so that I can measure **OOM handling and throughput degradation**.
* *As a CPU-only environment tester,* I want to run workloads on **CPU inference mode**, so that I can validate **fallback performance**.
* *As a systems architect,* I want to distribute workloads across **multiple GPUs**, so that I can evaluate **parallelism scaling efficiency**.
* *As a platform engineer,* I want to run benchmarks across **multi-node clusters**, so that I can measure **network overhead and load balancing**.

## 7. Cost & Efficiency Scenarios

* *As a cost-conscious product owner,* I want to run the **same workload on small and large models**, so that I can compare **tokens per dollar efficiency**.
* *As an ML engineer,* I want to compare **quantized vs full-precision runs**, so that I can understand **trade-offs in speed vs. accuracy**.
* *As an infrastructure manager,* I want to measure **energy consumption per token**, so that I can track **sustainability and power efficiency**.
