# ðŸ§  Design Philosophy

Everything we build â€” whether code, architecture, or documentation â€” must be **driven by design thinking**.

We prioritize **user experience, simplicity, and storytelling** at every step.

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity over complexity** â€” make interactions effortless and intuitive.
- **Purposeful storytelling** â€” every feature should fit into a clear, compelling narrative.
- **Reducing Friction (BJ Fogg adapted)**  
  - Focus on **making actions easier**, not forcing motivation.  
  - A well-designed system should make the right path **obvious and frictionless**.
  - Motivation is unreliable â€” **clarity and simplicity are sustainable**.
- **Kahneman's Systems**  
  - Support both intuitive fast decisions (System 1) and deep thinking (System 2).
- **Delight at every touchpoint** â€” surprise and delight users with thoughtful details.

## Design Thinking Rules
- Start with empathy: deeply understand user needs and context.
- Define the problem clearly before proposing solutions.
- Prototype and test quickly; embrace iteration.
- Build with accessibility and inclusivity from day one.
- Design **experience first, technology second**.
- Use **human language** in code, docs, and interfaces.

> These principles apply to everything â€” APIs, system design, error handling, team processes â€” not just visual interfaces.
