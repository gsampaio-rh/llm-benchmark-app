# Error Handling

- Never hide errors or mock functionality to "work around" problems.
- Failures must be **visible and debuggable**.
- Provide **clear, human-readable error messages**.
- Mock only when explicitly requested.

# Design Perspective on Errors
- Error messages are part of the user experience.
- Clarity and tone matter: make errors **helpful, not frustrating**.
